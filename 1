AIM Definition:
AIM refers to the study of fundamental network commands and configuration commands that are used to configure, diagnose, and troubleshoot network settings in a computer or device. The two key words in the AIM definition are:

Network Commands: These are command-line instructions that allow users to interact with and manage the network configuration and network status of a computer system.
Network Configuration Commands: These commands specifically allow users to configure or change settings related to the network, such as IP addresses, gateways, DNS settings, etc.
Command Details:
ipconfig

Definition: Displays the current IP configuration of the system, including IP addresses, subnet mask, and default gateway.
Usage: ipconfig
Example Output:
yaml
Copy code
Windows IP Configuration
Ethernet adapter Ethernet:
  IPv4 Address.................... : 192.168.6.31
  Subnet Mask..................... : 255.255.255.0
  Default Gateway................. : 192.168.6.1
Explanation: This command provides the IP address information, subnet mask, and default gateway of your network interfaces.
ipconfig /all

Definition: Provides detailed information about the system’s network configuration, including DNS servers, MAC address, DHCP status, etc.
Usage: ipconfig /all
Example Output:
yaml
Copy code
Host Name: PGLAB-31
Primary Dns Suffix: 
DHCP Enabled: No
DNS Servers: 192.168.6.1
Explanation: Adds more detailed network information compared to ipconfig, including DHCP settings, DNS information, and other network adapter details.
ping

Definition: Tests the network connectivity to a specified remote host by sending ICMP Echo Request messages.
Usage: ping [hostname/IP]
Example:
Copy code
ping google.com
Explanation: Sends four ICMP Echo requests to the given domain or IP address and reports back on the status of the packets (e.g., response time, packet loss).
nslookup

Definition: Queries the DNS records for a given domain name to resolve its IP address.
Usage: nslookup [hostname]
Example:
Copy code
nslookup www.gmail.com
Explanation: It provides information on the IP address and DNS information for the specified domain.
tracert

Definition: Traces the path taken by packets to reach a remote host. It shows each hop and time to each router along the way.
Usage: tracert [hostname/IP]
Example:
Copy code
tracert www.gmail.com
Explanation: Displays each router and the time taken for each hop until the destination is reached, helping diagnose routing issues.
hostname

Definition: Displays the name of the current machine (computer).
Usage: hostname
Example:
Copy code
PGLAB-31
Explanation: Outputs the machine's hostname, which can be used to identify the device on a network.
systeminfo

Definition: Displays detailed system configuration information, including OS version, hardware configuration, and memory usage.
Usage: systeminfo
Example:
yaml
Copy code
OS Name: Microsoft Windows 8.1 Pro
System Manufacturer: Dell Inc.
Total Physical Memory: 5,020 MB
Explanation: Provides details about the machine’s system configuration, including OS, memory, and network adapter.
pathping

Definition: A combination of ping and tracert that provides both the path taken by the packets and statistical analysis of packet loss at each hop.
Usage: pathping [hostname/IP]
Example:
Copy code
pathping gmail.com
Explanation: Combines both trace route information and packet loss details to provide a more comprehensive picture of network performance.
netstat

Definition: Displays network connections, routing tables, interface statistics, and other networking information.
Usage: netstat
Example:
css
Copy code
Active Connections
Proto Local Address Foreign Address State
TCP 192.168.6.31:53026 ec2-35-163-171-85:https ESTABLISHED
Explanation: Shows active TCP connections, listening ports, and the status of each connection.
arp

Definition: Displays or modifies the Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) cache, which maps IP addresses to physical MAC addresses.
Usage: arp -a
Example:
css
Copy code
Internet Address Physical Address Type
192.168.6.1 2c-c8-1b-69-97-12 dynamic
Explanation: Shows the MAC addresses associated with IP addresses, which helps in troubleshooting network issues related to IP address resolution.
